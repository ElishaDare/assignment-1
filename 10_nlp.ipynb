It has a process to automatically get labels from the data, and this task isn't trivial: to properly guess the next word in a sentence, the model will have to develop an understanding of the English (or other) language. Self-supervised learning can also be used in other domains; for instance, see [\"Self-Supervised Learning and Computer Vision\"](https://www.fast.ai/2020/01/13/self_supervised/) for an introduction to vision applications. Self-supervised learning is not usually used for the model that is trained directly, but instead is used for pretraining a model used for transfer learning."

        "The language model we used in <<chapter_intro>> to classify IMDb reviews was pretrained on Wikipedia. We got great results by directly fine-tuning this language model to a movie review classifier, but with one extra step, we can do even better. The Wikipedia English is slightly different from the IMDb English, so instead of jumping directly to the classifier, we could fine-tune our pretrained language model to the IMDb corpus and then use *that* as the base for our classifier.\n",
        "\n",
        "Even if our language model knows the basics of the language we are using in the task (e.g., our pretrained model is in English), it helps to get used to the style of the corpus we are targeting. It may be more informal language, or more technical, with new words to learn or different ways of composing sentences. In the case of the IMDb dataset, there will be lots of names of movie directors and actors, and often a less formal style of language than that seen in Wikipedia.\n",

So, why are we learning how to train a language model in detail?\n",

But there is another very practical reason, which is that you get even better results if you fine-tune the (sequence-based) language model prior to fine-tuning the classification model. For instance, for the IMDb sentiment analysis task, the dataset includes 50,000 additional movie reviews that do not have any positive or negative labels attached. Since there are 25,000 labeled reviews in the training set and 25,000 in the validation set, that makes 100,000 movie reviews altogether. We can use all of these reviews to fine-tune the pretrained language model, which was trained only on Wikipedia articles; this will result in a language model that is particularly good at predicting the next word of a movie review.\n",

The [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06146) showed that this extra stage of fine-tuning of the language model, prior to transfer learning to a classification task, resulted in significantly better predictions. Using this approach, we have three stages for transfer learning in NLP, as summarized in <<ulmfit_process>>."

Word tokenization relies on an assumption that spaces provide a useful separation of components of meaning in a sentence. However, this assumption is not always appropriate. For instance, consider this sentence: 我的名字是郝杰瑞 (\"My name is Jeremy Howard\" in Chinese). That's not going to work very well with a word tokenizer, because there are no spaces in it! Languages like Chinese and Japanese don't use spaces, and in fact they don't even have a well-defined concept of a \"word.\" There are also languages, like Turkish and Hungarian, that can add many subwords together without spaces, creating very long words that include a lot of separate pieces of information.\n",

For instance, if the stream has 50,000 tokens and we set a batch size of 10, this will give us 10 mini-streams of 5,000 tokens. What is important is that we preserve the order of the tokens (so from 1 to 5,000 for the first mini-stream, then from 5,001 to 10,000...), because we want the model to read continuous rows of text (as in the preceding example). An `xxbos` token is added at the start of each during preprocessing, so that the model knows when it reads the stream when a new entry is beginning.\n",

        "<font color='blue'> This chapter talks about NLP natural language processing. The area of focus in the paper was to build a large language model which helps using recurrent neural networks (RNN) and transfer learning techniques. An NLP task shown in the paper shows us the importance of deep learning in achieving excellent results with NLP tasks. Similar to computer vision tasks the difference in transfer learning and computer vision tasks. NLP pretrained models are typically trained on a different task. Self supervised learning trains a model using labelling input in the indeoendent variable instead of relying n external labels. The trainig language model example is meant to make the model predict the next word in the text. ULM fit approach involves finetuning the pretrained language model on a target before transferring it to a classification task. It helps improve predictions.\n",
        "Another topic spoken about was text preprocessing for NLP it is necessary to build a language model including tokenization, numericalization and encoding data loaders for the model. Tokenization explains word and subword tokenization methods and their importance in converting text into numerical form that can easily processed. Then numericalization is the process of mapping tokens to integers, making them more suitable for input into neural networks. We then put the texts into batches for efficient processing by the model. It is important for sequences of varying lenghts. Finally we train the text classifier using transfer learning which includes finetuing a pretrained language model and training a classifier on top of it.  "

This should sound familiar: we had the same issue with images. In that case, we used cropping, padding, and/or squishing to make all the inputs the same size. Cropping might not be a good idea for documents, because it seems likely we'd remove some key information (having said that, the same issue is true for images, and we use cropping there; data augmentation hasn't been well explored for NLP yet, so perhaps there are actually opportunities to use cropping in NLP too!).

Additionally, to avoid memory issues and improve performance, we will batch together texts that are roughly the same lengths (with some shuffling for the training set). We do this by (approximately, for the training set) sorting the documents by length prior to each epoch. The result of this is that the documents collated into a single batch will tend to be of similar lengths. We won't pad every batch to the same size, but will instead use the size of the largest document in each batch as the target size. (It is possible to do something similar with images, which is especially useful for irregularly sized rectangular images, but at the time of writing no library provides good support for this yet, and there aren't any papers covering it.

First we peformed data gathering which basialled gathers text data from the specified folders in the code. The function collects text files from the directories such as train and test and unsupervised. Then we created a language model datablock creation. The datablock is used to prepare data for language model training. the blocls parameter specifies the type of data blocks to use. In this case textblock is used to tokenize and prepare text fata from specified path. Then we split the data into two for training and validation . then next a code was written to create the dataloaders giving them lenghts, weight etc. Language model finetuning was also done to our work for finetuning our model. And then the language model weas trained for one epoch after trainig the encoder pat of the model is saved. For text classification we created another datablock this time to prepare the model for classification. we then tokenized and prepared the text data but then we addeda category block to specify the labels. Vocabulary from the models finetuning was also used to to ensure consistency in token-to-index correspondence. Data splitting is also done again and the test folder is used for validation. Text classifier learner is then used to learn text classification. These shows the steps used in NLP MODEL training."
